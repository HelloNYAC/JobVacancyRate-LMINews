																	<p class="manual_details">&#8594 Although our team has access to Job Vacancy Rate for each Economic Region but my goal was to practice using APIS. I decided to stick with whatever the API provides.</p>

																	<p class="manual_details">&#8594 I didn't understand the <b>rule of nameing these IDs</b> until I got stuck with different API methods. I then realized the key is to know the rule of naming the IDs.</p>
