																	<p class="manual_details">&#8594 The initial plan was to be able to find <b>the corelation between Job Vacancy Rate for different NOC based on LMI News published</b>, but there weren't enough information to complete the analysis.</p>
																	<p class="manual_details">&#8594 I then switched my focus to <b>job vacancies for different Ecnomic Region</b>, hoping that this project will provide job vacancy rate to the level of Ecmonic Regions. But data was not availabe from Statstic Can for the Regions, it was only good at the provincial level.</p>
																	<p class="manual_details">&#8594 So the project is forced to work on provincial level to show desired job vacancy rate and job vacancies as per users' needs.</p>

																	<p class="manual_details">&#8594 Initially I didn't understand the <b>rule of nameing these IDs</b>. Was trying different methods and got stuck on all methods I have tried because they all comes down to kowning the rule of naming the IDs.</p>
