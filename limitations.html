																	<p class="manual_details">&#8594 The initial plan was to be able to find out<b>(1) Job Vacancy Rate for different NOC; (2) NOC related LMI News when user runs a search on NOC; (3) Show Job Vacancy Rate and LMI News for certain Ecnomic Region.</b> But there weren't enough information through the Statistics Canada API to complete the analysis.</p>
																	<p class="manual_details">&#8594 Although our team has access to Job Vacancy Rate for each Ecnomic Region but my goal was to pratice using APIS. I decided to stick with whatever the API provides.</p>
																	<p class="manual_details">&#8594 So I choose to focus on provincial level to show desired job vacancy rate and job vacancies as per users' needs.</p>

																	<p class="manual_details">&#8594 The preparation work was a lot in order to be able to gain data directly from Statistics Canada website</p>

																	<p class="manual_details">&#8594 Initially I didn't understand the <b>rule of nameing these IDs</b>. Was trying different methods and got stuck on all methods I have tried because they all comes down to kowning the rule of naming the IDs.</p>
